# musicbrainz-userscripts

**[Userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) for [MusicBrainz.org](https://musicbrainz.org)**

This project deals with **userscripts** which should help to add releases and further entries to the **MusicBrainz.org** project. The main focus of the scripts is on audio drama releases.

You need a **userscripts** manager browser extension such as **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)**, which manages the userscripts for you.
To install a script, simply click on the _Install_ button for the desired script on this page.
